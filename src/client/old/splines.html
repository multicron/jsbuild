    <h1>Welcome to Splines.io!</h1>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Splines.io is a fun new multiplayer online
video game where you steer your line to try to get other players to
run into your tail, while also trying to avoid running into other players' tails.
You can cross over your own tail, but you can't cross over anyone
else's tail or your line will die.  You can use the space bar to dash.
As your score increases, your scale increases and you will be able to
see more of the playing field.  You can also increase your scale by
running over the blue powerup that looks like a plus sign.  If you run
over the green powerup that looks like a times sign, you will score
double points for the next 30 seconds.  You can see how much time you
have remaining on your powerups in the scoreboard in the upper left of
the screen.  The leaderboard is shown in the upper right of the
screen, and a small radar of the entire playing field is shown in the
lower right.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Splines.io is similar to slither.io, wormate.io, powerline.io,
and paper.io, so if you enjoy playing those games, you should try splines.io!</p>
