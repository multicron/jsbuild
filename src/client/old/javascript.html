    <h1>Why I Don't Hate Javascript Anymore!</h1>
<p>
I hated JavaScript for 25 years and I hated it because it was implemented inconsistently across platforms, it had a lot of bugs, and the bugs were different on every platform. And to a large extent this is still true. But a few things happened to make JavaScript an acceptable programming language for me.
</p>
<p>
The first thing that happened was the creation of a build system for JavaScript, making it possible to write the same code in the same way for both the server and the browser.   In particular, it became possible to share the same Library between browser code and server code. The advantage of being able to code both halves of a system in the same language using the same libraries is considerable.
</p><p>
The second thing that made me stop hating JavaScript was the creation of a transpiler for JavaScript which translates the latest JavaScript specification with all its  standardization and extensions into the existing JavaScript available on the server and/or browser platform.  Coupled with the build system, this eliminated my two major complaints about JavaScript.
</p><p>
The third thing that made me stop hating JavaScript is the creation of the websockets library which allowed me to “abstract away” a whole bunch of networking software that I really didn't care to write.
</p><p>
And so the game splines.IO was born.
</p><p>Splines.io is a fairly standard massively multiplayer network game. The entire game is actually played on the server, so no amount of hacking the client can give the user much advantage. It depends strongly on good network latency (<100ms) and consumes a surprisingly large amount of data per player (25k bytes per second).  As such, it doesn't make much sense to release the game until it is able to produce some income.
